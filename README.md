# MLSP PROJECT

For this exam, you have to download and use the following csv file: titanic.csv. You will make groups of 4 or 5 students.

Your rendering will take the form of a fully commented Jupyter notebook. You will necessarily use Python libraries, in particular pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, seaborn.

Here is a description (Links to an external site.) of the data set.

The goal is to perform a binary classification on the variable "survived".

Load the data set.
Make a complete explanatory analysis (graphics, statistics, etc.) for each variable.
Separate the data set in train set and test set.
Preprocess the data. Use the function « ColumnTransformer » to do that. Explain precisely each step, in particular when you drop, impute or transform the variables.
Use the k-NN classifier to perform the classification. Find the best hyperparameters with a brute force technique. Compute classical metrics: recall, precision, F1 score, confusion matrix.
Same question with the Support Vector Machine classifier.
Same question with the Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier.
Same question with the Logistic Regression classifier.
Same question with the Decision Tree classifier. Draw the resulting tree.
Same question with a Voting Classifier using the previous algorithms. Explain precisely how it works.
Same question with the Random Forest classifier.
Same question with the Gradient Boosting classifier.
Same question with the AdaBoost classifier.
Compare the performances of the previous algorithms.
